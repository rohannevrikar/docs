# ILD User Manual

## Overview
ILD (Intelligent Layout Designer) is a content layout and publishing platform that enables structured magazine article creation using a blend of automation and designer-friendly editing tools. This manual provides a step-by-step guide through ILD’s capabilities—from article creation to publishing.

---

## 1. Logging In

## 2. Article Dashboard
After login, you will land on the **Article Dashboard**, which offers the following options:

   - **Number of Pages** (e.g., 3 pages)
3. Click on the **"Plan Article"** button.

### What Happens Next:

## 4. Entering Content
### Flex Frame Content Input:
- Select a Flex Frame to begin editing.
- Layout sections are divided into structured inputs:
  - **Text Sections** (Headline, Standfirst, Body Copy)
  - **Image Sections**
- The **Layout Guide** shows a preview of the page and helps map input fields (e.g., ID 7 = body copy).

### Character Limit Validation:
- Input fields are monitored for recommended character counts.
- Over-limit fields turn **yellow** (warning).
- Fix by shortening text until it turns **green** (valid).

### Image Upload:
- Upload images to corresponding placeholders.

### Save Progress:
- Click **“Save and Continue”** after each page to ensure content is stored for future editing.

### Notes:
- Processing time depends on number/size of images (1–2 mins or more).

Once content is populated:
- Click **“Convert to PDF”** for each Flex Frame.
- PDFs can be viewed after conversion.
